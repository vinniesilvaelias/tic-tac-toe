The implementation is based on an intuitive **Start menu** in which players enter their respective names and symbols, and press the play button to start the game. If players leave the options blank, the game automatically inserts the fields, with **"Player one"** as **'X'**, and **"Player two"** as **'O'**. Then, a new window containing the game opens.

The name of the **current player is indicated at the top**. In the middle there is the board that starts empty and will be filled with the symbol of the current player, **changing the color of each field**.
If any player performs a sequence of three symbols, **a dialog box opens informing the winner's name by means of an animation**, in addition to **highlighting each field in the sequence**. If there is a tie, **the color of the board changes and an animation indicates the tie**.
If you want to **restart the game**, just click on the "New game" button at any time.
